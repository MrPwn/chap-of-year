This application is an easy to use way to view the events and volunteering activities of my college fraternity chapter. 

Upon opening the application, the user is immediately greeted with a map of the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex with various pins representing chapter volunteer activities and events. The user can navigate and zoom into loctions, select a pin that interests them, and watch a video about the event.
